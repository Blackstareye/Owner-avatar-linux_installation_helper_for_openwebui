This shell script, named `linux_run.sh`, automates the process of setting up and running an Open WebUI environment in a virtual Python environment called "openwebuivenv". Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

### Installation Steps
1. **Execution**: Save this script into a file named `linux_run.sh` (or any name you prefer). Make sure the file has executable permissions by running `chmod +x linux_run.sh`.
2. **Environment Creation**: When executed with the `-r` flag (`./linux_run.sh -r`), the script will create a virtual environment using Python 3.11, install the necessary Open WebUI package via pip within that environment, and display a success message.

### Usage
After creating the script, you can run it with or without the `-r` flag:
- **Without `-r`**: This will simply activate the "openwebuivenv" virtual environment and execute `open-webui serve`.
   ```bash
   ./linux_run.sh
   ```
- **With `-r`**: this will perform a full setup, including installing a new virtual environment and its dependencies.
   ```bash
   ./linux_run.sh -r
   ```

### Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system before running the script. Additionally, `pip` should be available for package installation within this virtual environment.
